Paste these 10 questions in for AP Statistics: 

1. Sampling Distribution & Central Limit Theorem
Question: A large city survey sampled 20 twelfth-grade students' scores (out of 46) on an economics test. Given the data list, (a) construct a stemplot; (b) describe the distribution’s main features; (c) explain why reporting only a measure of center would be misleading.
Answer:
(a) You’d create a stemplot using the given scores (e.g., stems 0–4).
(b) Description should mention shape (possibly skewed/right due to few high scores), range, clusters, gaps, outliers.
(c) Because the distribution is varied and likely skewed, center alone (mean or median) wouldn’t capture spread or shape, leading to misrepresentation.

2. Probability & Binomial Reasoning
Question: The relative frequency distribution shows the number of pets (dogs + cats) per household. (a) Find the probability a randomly selected household violates a 3-pet limit law; (b) if 10 households are randomly chosen, what’s the probability exactly 2 violate the law?; (c) describe the sampling distribution of the mean number of pets for 150 households.
Answer:
(a) Sum probabilities for households owning 4+ pets.
(b) Use the binomial formula: n=10, p = probability from (a), so

(c) By CLT: approximately normal, center = population mean, spread = population SD / √150.

3. Experimental Design – Block Randomization
Question: In a heat gain experiment comparing window types A and B with 12 positions in a house, (a) devise appropriate blocks for a randomized block design; (b) describe how to assign treatments (window types) to boxes.
Answer:
(a) Block by house side or matched positions (e.g., north wall vs. south wall) to control for exposure.
(b) Randomly assign types A/B within each block (e.g., flip a coin for each pair).

4. Definition of Standard Deviation & Confidence Intervals
Question: (From 2007 scoring guidelines) Explain what 
𝑠
=
2.141
s=2.141 indicates in context, and use that to construct and interpret a confidence interval.
Answer:
Standard deviation 
𝑠
=
2.141
s=2.141 reflects the typical deviation of discoloration ratings from the mean in the control group. The CI centered on the sample mean ± (critical value × 
𝑠
/
𝑛
s/ 
n
​
 ) gives a plausible range for the population mean discoloration.

5. Hypothesis Testing & p-Value Interpretation
Question: Researchers test whether drivers are more distracted when using a device. Given a p-value of 0.0683, interpret it and state a conclusion in everyday language.
Answer:
The p-value 0.0683 is the chance of observing the data (or more extreme) if there really is no increased distraction. Since it's above common α (0.05), we fail to reject H₀—there's not strong evidence that the device increases distraction.

6. Geometric Distribution Expectation (2024 FRQ #4)
Question: Let Y be the number of geodes opened until (and including) the first red crystal appears, with given probabilities for y = 1, 2, 3, 4. (i) Compute mean of Y; (ii) interpret the mean.
Answer:
(i) Mean 
𝜇

∑
𝑦
⋅
𝑃
(
𝑌

)
μ=∑y⋅P(Y=y).
(ii) It represents the average number of geodes one would expect to open before finding a red crystal.

7. Conditional Probability (2024 FRQ #5b)
Question: Among collectors of baseball cards, given "fewer than 6 months" collectors numbered 91, and 80 of them have majority regular cards, find that conditional probability.
Answer:
𝑃
(
regular majority
∣
<6 mo
)
=
80
/
91
≈
0.879
P(regular majority∣<6 mo)=80/91≈0.879. 
AP Central

8. Chi-Square Test (2024 FRQ #5c)
Question: Name the appropriate hypothesis test for relationship between collecting duration and card type; state H₀ and Hₐ.
Answer:
Use a chi-square test of independence.

H₀: No association between collecting duration and card type.

Hₐ: There is an association. 
AP Central

9. Test Conclusion (2024 FRQ #5d)
Question: Given p-value = 0.0075 and conditions met, what conclusion?
Answer:
Since 0.0075 < 0.05, reject H₀. There is evidence of a statistically significant association between months collecting and card-type majority.

10. Descriptive Statistics & Distribution Shape (2024 FRQ #6)
Question: Based on a dotplot and summary stats for whistle prices, describe shape and identify outliers using 1.5×IQR rule.
Answer:
Describe skewness (e.g., symmetric, right/left skew), modality, spread using summary stats. For outliers: calculate IQR, then any point beyond Q1 – 1.5×IQR or Q3 + 1.5×IQR is an outlier.

10. Descriptive Statistics: Median & SD
Question: For the data set {28, 26, 40, 37, 39, 29, 31, 33, 33, 33, 31, 36}, find the median and standard deviation.
Answer:
Sorted data: {26, 28, 29, 31, 31, 33, 33, 33, 36, 37, 39, 40}. Median = average of 6th and 7th terms: (33 + 33)/2 = 33. SD: compute using the standard formula—find mean, squared deviations, divide by n−1, then square root.
